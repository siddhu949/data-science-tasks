# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
1. Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.
2. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance
issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and
F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for
improving results.
